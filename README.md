# Reminders CLI

A CLI tool for storing and retreiving reminders written in C.

Basic storage implementation finished but lots of work to do!

## Compile and run it

```bash
gcc -o remind main.c

# Add a reminder
./remind add

# Show reminders
./remind show

# Delete all reminders from storage
./remind dl
```
